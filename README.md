# Udacity-Data-Scientist-Nanodegree-project

The code and data in this repository is part of my project submissions for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.

The objective is set as follows:

1. Prepare the dataset for analysis
2. Summarize the behavioral characteristics of the fictious customers
3. Segment the customers as per their behavior
4. Describe the typical customer in each segment.

## Data

The dataset used is a ficticious one, that is collected on ficticious customers visiting a mall.

## Libraries used
The following libraries have been used:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn

## Summary

Making marketing campaigns more effective, reaching the right customer with the right messaging and offers, is the utlimate goal of every marketing profession. Byunderstanding the customer and their needs better, marketing campaigns could provide a significant boost to the business revenue.
Deep understanding of customers and their needs is beneficial not only to the company but also to the customer. For a small company, understanding the needs of all the customers is as easy as running a quick survey. But that becomes challenging for a big company. But this task could be simplified by condensing the big company customers into a few groups, or segments.
In this project, we were ableto come up with three segments of customers, but choosing a few attributes that I thought could best group the customers from their behavioral tendencies. I was able to decribe the typical customer within the three segments, that could ideally make it simple for a marketing manager to determine the right offer for each segment.
